<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>
A Screen Reader is a non-visual user interface for supported operating 
systems and applications. Whilst screen readers support many popular 
applications, screen readers do not support all applications. When an 
application isn't supported, the functionality is limited, and in 
extreme cases, cannot be used at all with a screen reader. <abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr> has its own scripting language to enable support for applications, and the <a href="http://www.blindprogramming.com/jfw.htm">programming community offers JAWS scripts</a> to work with other applications.
</p>
<p>
Until recently the only web browsing application that had practical 
support by the screen readers discussed in this article was Internet 
Explorer (and other applications that used the Internet Explorer engine 
to display <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents). The latest versions of <abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr> and Window-Eyes include support for the Firefox browser, although <a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs_products/software_jaws70fea.asp#Web">JAWS support for Firefox is still limited</a>
 compared to its support for Internet Explorer. Supernova supports 
Internet Explorer, and does not claim to support Firefox. From adhoc 
testing, it appears that Firefox can be used successfully with 
Supernova, although it is not as fully supported as Internet Explorer.
</p>
<p>
Screen reader support for browsing <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents in supported applications is achieved through a <dfn title="A snapshot of a web page that allows screen reader users to interact with the content">virtual buffer</dfn>. For a detailed explanation of screen reader modes, see <a href="http://juicystudio.com/article/making-ajax-work-with-screen-readers.php#screenmodes">making Ajax work with screen readers</a>. The virtual buffer facilitates much of the advanced functionality for navigating and providing access to content in <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
 documents; heading navigation, table header &amp; data interrogation, 
link and form control lists, expansions of abbreviations, and much more.

<h2 id="claimedsupport">Claimed Support for <code>mouseover</code></h2>
<p>
<abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr> has claimed support for the <code>mouseover</code> event since version 5.0; Supernova and Window-Eyes have never claimed support for the <code>mouseover</code> event.
</p>

<p class="skiplink">
[<a href="#toc">Back to the contents</a>]
</p>

<h2 id="jaws">JAWS</h2>
<p>
<abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr> support for the <code>mouseover</code> event is unbelievably crass — it depends entirely on identifying the <code>mouseover</code> attribute inline in the markup. If it finds an element with an <code>mouseover</code> attribute it will announce its presence to the user when the element with the attribute has <em>virtual focus</em>. If a user activates the <code>mouseover</code> event using the appropriate key combination, <abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr> will inform the user if the activation has resulted in a change in content that <abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr> could detect, and provide the location (line number) of where change occurred. The user can then use the <a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/HTML_challenge/files/navigation_challenge.html">Jump to line</a> function to move the virtual focus to that location in the document. <abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr>
 also has functionality (accessed via the HTML options dialog) that 
announces string literals within JavaScript code that are triggered by 
the <code>mouseover</code> event. From the following comments in the <abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr> script file containing the functions that enable this mechanism, it can be concluded that the mechanism by which <abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr> accesses a string literal is rudimentary to say the least:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>OnMouseOver</code> attributes are often used to run script functions to display tooltips containing useful information. If no <code>OnMouseOver</code> quoted text is found, <abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr> speaks the on screen text for the link. "OnMouseOver quoted text" is text provided through a function in the <code>OnMouseOver</code> <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> attribute, in the form of: <code>OnMouseOver="myfunction('information about link')"</code>. If more complex script code is referenced in the <code>OnMouseOver</code> attribute, the information is ignored.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<cite>Source: text comment in the JAWS 'Configuration Manager.jsb' file</cite>
</p>

<h3>JAWS <code>mouseover</code> conclusions</h3> 
<ul>
<li><abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr> announces the presence of inline <code>onmouseover</code> attributes on elements. The user can activate the event by using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Insert</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> keystroke combination when the virtual focus is on the element that has the event attached.</li>
<li>Its support (that is its identification and announcing of mouseover events) is based on it identifying the <code>onmouseover</code> attribute inline within the markup.</li>
<li>Whilst <abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr> doesn't announce the presence of <code>mouseover</code> events that aren't written inline, they can be activated using the keystroke combination, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Insert</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>. Of course, this is of little practical use, as the user isn't aware the <code>mouseover</code> event exists.</li>
<li>The event is simulated by causing the mouse cursor to physically 
move to the coordinates on the screen corresponding to the position of 
the element within the document. The coordinates used are those that <abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr> has stored in its virtual buffer.</li>
<li>Using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Insert</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> keystroke combination on an element with an <code>onmouseover</code> attribute identified by <abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr>, triggers a refresh of the virtual buffer. <abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr> then compares the new version with the previous version of the document. If <abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr> finds changes within the content of the document it announces the change; otherwise, it announces, <q>could not detect change in content</q>.</li>
<li>If a delay (&gt; 500 milliseconds) is placed on the processing of the script triggered by the <code>mouseover</code>
 event, the addition of the new content to the document in the web 
browser occurs after the "virtual buffer" has been refreshed. In this 
case <abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr> announces that it <q>could not detect change in content</q>.
 This results in a disconnect between the content that is presented to 
the screen reader user and the content displayed in the web browser.</li>
<li>If new content causes a change in the position of elements, but the 
new content is added following a delay, the virtual buffer will not 
contain the additional content, and element coordinates and other 
information available to JAWS from the virtual buffer will be outdated. 
If the <code>mouseover</code> event is triggered a second time, <abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr>
 moves the mouse cursor to the position in the document (in the web 
browser) using the outdated coordinates. Depending on the circumstances,
 the following might occur: 
<ul>
<li>an incorrect event being triggered</li>
<li>a correct event on a different element being triggered</li>
<li>or no event being triggered (if the outdated coordinates position the mouse cursor over an element with no attached events).</li>
</ul>
But it also results in <abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr> announcing that a change in content has occurred: The change identified by <abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr> is the content added due to the original triggering of the event, which was not identified by <abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr> initially, because it occurred after the virtual buffer was refreshed.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h2 id="wineyes">Window-Eyes</h2>
<p>
Window-Eyes does not claim to support the <code>mouseover</code> event, and the test results reflect this. If perchance the user knows that a <code>mouseover</code> event is attached to a particular element within a document and the user moves the virtual focus to that element, the <code>mouseover</code> event can be triggered by using the Window-Eyes <em>Mouse hot-key</em>: Mouse to focus <kbd>Insert</kbd> + <kbd>Numpad-Plus</kbd>, which results in the mouse cursor moving over the element with the attached <code>mouseover</code> event, but there is little practical value as the user is not informed of the presence of the <code>mouseover</code> attribute. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Activating the <code>mouseover</code> (using the mouse to focus hot key) does not result in the virtual buffer being refreshed.</li>
<li>Tests incorporating a delay and a change in element position do not result in the element coordinates being outdated.</li>
</ul>

<p class="skiplink">
[<a href="#toc">Back to the contents</a>]
</p>

<h2 id="supernova">Supernova</h2>
<p>
While Supernova does not claim to support the <code>mouseover</code> event and does not inform the user that an element has this event attached, the event can be triggered by the pressing of the <kbd>Enter</kbd>
 key when an element has virtual focus. This is due to the mechanism by 
which Supernova passes keystroke commands to the web browser. Unlike <abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr> and Window-Eyes, the mouse cursor is moved to the location of the element that has virtual focus whenever the <kbd>Enter</kbd>
 key is pressed. It appears that this method is used by Supernova to 
activate links. There is little practical value, as the user is not 
informed of the presence of the <code>mouseover</code> event, but the additional content is available to the user once added.
</p>

<p class="skiplink">
[<a href="#toc">Back to the contents</a>]
</p>

<h2 id="thetests">The Tests</h2>
<p>
The tests consist of documents containing either an anchor (<code>a</code> element) or a paragraph (<code>p</code> element) with an inline <code>onmouseover</code>
 attribute that activates a JavaScript function. The function either 
adds text content to the element containing the event or to another 
element prior to the element containing the event. The latter results in
 the position of the element containing the event being changed by the 
addition of new content.
</p>
<p>
Each test has two conditions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>the function is processed immediately</li>
<li>the function is processed after a delay of 1500 milliseconds.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The reason for the second condition is that there is a delay between 
when an event is triggered by some screen readers and the triggering of 
the refresh of the document copy that is stored in the virtual buffer. 
For <abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr>, the delay is 
approximately 500 milliseconds; for Window-Eyes, the delay is 
approximately 900 milliseconds. The delay, if there is one, for 
Supernova could not be ascertained. So the delay condition was included 
to investigate the issues that arise from content changes that occur 
after a  user event caused the virtual buffer to be refreshed.
</p>

</p>

<h2 id="testconditions">Test Conditions</h2>
<p>
All test were conducted using Internet Explorer 6.0, <abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr> v7.1 beta, Window-Eyes 5.5, and Supernova 6.51. The default mode of the screen readers was used for the tests (<abbr title="Job Access With Speech">JAWS</abbr> — Virtual PC Cursor; Window-eyes — Browse mode; Supernova — Virtual focus).

<h2 id="voiceover">VoiceOver</h2>
<p>
The Mac OS X Tiger has "built-in" screen reading software called <a href="http://developer.apple.com/accessibility/">VoiceOver</a>. When it comes to accessing <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents, an initial assessment from an article on VoiceOver published by the (U.S.) <a href="http://juicystudio.com/article/www.nfb.org">National Federation of the Blind</a> concludes:
</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.voiceofthenationsblind.org/articles/147/voiceover-accessibility-out-of-the-box-at-last">
<p>
VoiceOver, in its current technical state, lacks the sophistication and 
maturity to be capable of allowing efficient Internet Browsing by blind 
users.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/">Roger Johansson</a> has a <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200505/voiceover_and_safari_screen_reading_on_the_mac/">more positive opinion of VoiceOver</a>. Roger states, <q>It
 doesn't have all the features of a more advanced screen reader like 
JAWS, but from the testing I have done so far it seems to do a decent 
job.</q>, but points out that he is, <q>by no means as experienced with screen readers as someone using one on a daily basis.</q>
</p>

<h3>VoiceOver <code>mouseover</code> test results</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://alastairc.ac/">Alastair Campbell</a> has kindly provided his results using VoiceOver.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether it's a link or just text, there is no indication that there is a mouseover event to trigger.</li>
<li>There is no assigned keyboard command to activate onmouseover.</li>
<li>However, <em>if</em> you knew there was something to activate, you 
can make the mouse pointer go to the current keyboard cursor position 
with, "Move VO to mouse" (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd>), which will activate the <code>mouseover</code> event.</li>
<li>If the mouse pointer is set to follow the keyboard cursor "<a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=VoiceOver/1.0/en/mh2053.html">Mouse cursor tracks VoiceOver cursor</a>", tabbing through the content causes the mouse pointer to move with the keyboard cursor. In this case, the <code>mouseover</code> event will fire on elements that have a <code>mouseover</code> event attached as you move through the content.</li> 
<li>Activating "Move VO to mouse" on a link results in the cursor moving to the top of the screen.</li>
<li>Activating "Move VO to mouse" on text results in the cursor remaining over the text.</li>
<li>With the non-link events, moving focus away from the text and back 
again results in the new text (content) being available to the user.</li>
<li>On <a href="http://sf.id.au/js_tests/onmouseover/mouseover-event-non%20link-add-text.html">test 7</a>, the cursor is left in the same place as the new text, but if you query the current item, it reads out the former text.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Alastair also posted a request for <a href="http://www.macvisionaries.com/pipermail/discuss_macvisionaries.com/2006-July/015400.html">feedback on the macvisionaries mailing list</a>, which elicited testing results from other users.

<p>Interesting stuff - how does this compare with other events, particularly onClick?</p><p>

<p>The event is called mouseover, actually.</p><p>

<blockquote><p>The event is called mouseover, actually.</p></blockquote><p>Thanks,
 Anne, that's a good point. I suspect it was being referred to as 
onmouseover in the article, as that's how the JAWS documentation refers 
to it. I've updated all references of the event to mouseover, apart from
 the parts that are referring to the onmouseover attribute.</p><p>
Thanks,</p><p>

<p>what a great article.... thanks so much for putting the effort in to 
produce this article as the topic needs addressing and clarity.... which
 i now feel i have.</p><p>
what is more interesting for me is to understand in terms SEO, is a link
 more important then a H1 tag?? i guess what i need to find is someone 
who knows what HTML elements have higher relivance for SEO.</p><p>
thanks for the article and an intersting read.</p><p>

<p>As always, a very thorough and exacting description, offered in enough detail to be completely understandable.   THANKS!</p><p>
Now, there are about a zillion more JavaScript events to test, and a LOT
 more writing if you want to describe each with this level of detail.</p><p>
Over at the access-matters site, James Edwards, Mike Stenhouse, and 
Derek Featherstone cooked up some JavaScript test cases and I hosted 
them.  The results, one set for link events [1], the other set for form 
events[2], are very extensive and might be an interesting supplement to 
this article.  </p><p>
However, none of us have had the patience to describe the results as well as you do for this single event.</p><p>
